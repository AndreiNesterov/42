\begin{itemize}
  \item Uncovering the Semantics of Wikipedia Categories. \cite{HeistHeiko2019}
  This work introduces an approach for the discovery of category axioms that uses information from the category network, category instances, and their lexicalisations with DBpedia as background knowledge.
\end{itemize}
